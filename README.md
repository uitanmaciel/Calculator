This was the first challenge proposed to students in the Initial C# course.
This course was taught by me, online and free.

The objective of this challenge was to consolidate the concepts studied up to that point in the fundamentals of the C# language.

In this challenge we explore the concepts of:
- Conditional Structures;
- Repetition Structures;
- Namespaces and Using;
- Arithmetic Operators;
- Data typing;
- Data conversions
